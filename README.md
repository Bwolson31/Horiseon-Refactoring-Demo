# Horiseon-Refactoring-Demo


## Description

This refactoring was done in order to streamline the Horiseon website and make it more accessible to users. Alt tags have been added and the color contrast has been heightened. Additionally, the broken "Search Engine Optimization" link has been fixed and several unnecessary class selectors were reduced to a single container class. Through this project, I learned to better implement HTML and CSS. I also learned how important it is always be thinking about how to make code more accessible and efficient.
